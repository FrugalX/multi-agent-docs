# Self-Orchestrated Multi-Agent System for Collaborative Task Management: Project Execution Plan

This document outlines an iterative approach to building the "Self-Orchestrated Multi-Agent System for Collaborative Task Management", including all core components such as Task Manager, Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine, Event-Driven Workflow Engine, Dynamic Agent Creator, and the Web-Based Interface.

---

## Execution Steps

### Iteration 1: Basic Setup
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.
   - Set up a basic Node.js server and React front-end.
   - Verify the setup by hosting a "Hello World" page.

2. **Integrate an LLM API**
   - Choose and integrate an LLM API (e.g., Hugging Face or Gemini).
   - Create a simple API wrapper to send a query and display the response on the web page.

---

### Iteration 2: Task Manager
1. **Basic Task Manager Implementation**
   - Define a schema for tasks (task ID, description, status).
   - Implement a backend API to create, update, and fetch tasks.
   - Display a task list on the front-end with basic CRUD operations.

2. **Enhance Task Management**
   - Add status tracking (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).
   - Introduce priority levels or deadlines for tasks.

---

### Iteration 3: Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine
1. **LLM-Based Task Analysis**
   - Implement a module that sends high-level task descriptions to the LLM API for decomposition.
   - Return a list of sub-tasks with brief descriptions.

2. **Integration with Task Manager**
   - Modify the Task Manager to accept sub-tasks and link them to the parent task.
   - Allow users to view and manage sub-tasks in the UI.

---

### Iteration 4: Dynamic Agent Creator
1. **Static Agent Prototypes**
   - Develop prototype agents that can perform specific tasks (e.g., text summarization, translation).
   - Test agents in isolation to verify their functionality.

2. **Dynamic Agent Creation Module**
   - Implement a backend service to instantiate agents dynamically based on sub-tasks.
   - Each agent should have a unique ID and be associated with a specific sub-task.

3. **Task Assignment and Monitoring**
   - Modify the Task Manager to assign sub-tasks to agents.
   - Implement APIs for agents to report their progress and results back to the Task Manager.

---

### Iteration 5: Event-Driven Workflow Engine
1. **Event Listener Implementation**
   - Define a schema for events (event ID, type, payload).
   - Implement an event queue system (e.g., in-memory or using a database).
   - Develop backend services to publish and listen for events.

2. **Integrate with Agents**
   - Modify agents to emit events (e.g., `task_completed`) and subscribe to relevant events.
   - Ensure agents can trigger workflows based on event updates.

3. **Workflow Coordination**
   - Implement logic to handle task dependencies and event propagation.
   - Test end-to-end workflows involving multiple agents.

---

### Iteration 6: Web-Based Interface
1. **Basic Task Input and Monitoring**
   - Create a front-end form for users to submit high-level tasks.
   - Display task progress and results in a user-friendly interface.

2. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to provide real-time updates on task statuses and agent activities.

3. **Visual Workflow Representation**
   - Develop a graphical representation of workflows, showing tasks, sub-tasks, and agent assignments.

---

### Iteration 7: System Testing and Optimization
1. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - Write tests for individual components (Task Manager, agents, workflow engine).
   - Test integrations between components to ensure smooth communication.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the dynamic agent creation process for speed and resource efficiency.
   - Enhance event handling to support high-concurrency scenarios.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement robust error-handling mechanisms across the system.
   - Add logging and monitoring tools for debugging and performance analysis.

---

### Iteration 8: Advanced Features
1. **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**
   - Enable agents to collaborate on tasks requiring input from multiple sources.
   - Add support for multi-modal tasks (e.g., combining text and image generation).

2. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to deploy agents.
   - Explore cloud-based solutions for hosting and scaling the system.

3. **User Feedback Mechanism**
   - Allow users to rate task results and provide feedback.
   - Use feedback to improve task decomposition and agent performance.

## Final Deliverables
- A fully functional web-based multi-agent system for generative AI task orchestration.
- Comprehensive documentation, including codebase, API references, and user manual.
- A presentation showcasing the systemâ€™s capabilities and real-world applications.
