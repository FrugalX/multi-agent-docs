# Project Execution Plan: Dynamic Agent Creation

## Synopsis
The **Dynamic Agent Creation** component focuses on developing an automated system to instantiate and manage agents for task execution. Each agent is tailored to a specific sub-task, leveraging LLM APIs to complete assigned goals. The key features of this component include dynamic instantiation, efficient resource utilization, and seamless integration with the overall workflow system.

The project aims to:
- Dynamically generate agents based on sub-tasks.
- Ensure modular and scalable agent behavior.
- Utilize LLM APIs for task-specific computations.

## Iterative Project Execution Plan
### Iteration 1: Initial Setup
- **Goal**: Establish a basic environment for project development.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a Node.js project.
  2. Install required dependencies (e.g., Express, Axios, dotenv).
  3. Create a simple API call to a freely available LLM (e.g., Hugging Face or Google Gemini).
  4. Test and document the API call output.

### Iteration 2: Basic Agent Implementation
- **Goal**: Create a prototype agent that can perform a static task.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define an `Agent` class with basic properties (e.g., `id`, `task`).
  2. Create an `execute` method for the agent to complete a static task (e.g., simple text summarization using an LLM API).
  3. Test the `Agent` class with hardcoded task inputs.

### Iteration 3: Agent Factory for Dynamic Creation
- **Goal**: Introduce a factory pattern for creating agents dynamically.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement an `AgentFactory` class to instantiate agents based on input parameters.
  2. Define JSON input for specifying task details (e.g., type, description).
  3. Modify the `execute` method to handle task-specific logic dynamically.
  4. Test with multiple agent instances and validate outputs.

### Iteration 4: Integration with Task Decomposition
- **Goal**: Enable agent creation based on decomposed tasks.
- **Steps**:
  1. Parse a JSON file of decomposed tasks generated by the Task Decomposition component.
  2. Use `AgentFactory` to create agents dynamically for each sub-task.
  3. Verify that agents correctly execute their assigned tasks.
  4. Document the integration process.

### Iteration 5: Event Handling and Communication
- **Goal**: Incorporate event-driven communication between agents and the Task Manager.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define events (e.g., `task_started`, `task_completed`, `error_occurred`).
  2. Implement an event emitter/listener model for agent-task communication.
  3. Test the event system with simulated tasks and validate correct sequencing.

### Iteration 6: Resource Optimization
- **Goal**: Implement resource-aware dynamic agent instantiation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Add a `ResourceManager` class to track available resources (e.g., memory, API rate limits).
  2. Modify `AgentFactory` to create agents only if resources are available.
  3. Test resource-constrained scenarios and ensure stability.

### Iteration 7: Scaling and Load Testing
- **Goal**: Validate system behavior under high task loads.
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate large JSON task inputs.
  2. Conduct load testing to observe agent instantiation and execution performance.
  3. Optimize the system for better scalability (e.g., concurrency limits).

## JSON Schema for Task Input
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "taskId": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Unique identifier for the task."
    },
    "taskType": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Type of task the agent will handle."
    },
    "taskDetails": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "description": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Detailed description of the task."
        },
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "additionalProperties": true,
          "description": "Parameters required for task execution."
        }
      },
      "required": ["description"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["taskId", "taskType", "taskDetails"]
}
```

## Example Task Input
```json
{
  "taskId": "001",
  "taskType": "text_summary",
  "taskDetails": {
    "description": "Summarize the provided text using LLM API.",
    "parameters": {
      "text": "Large language models are transforming AI..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflow
1. Task Manager receives the above JSON input.
2. `AgentFactory` dynamically creates an agent for `taskId: 001`.
3. The agent executes the `text_summary` task using the provided `parameters.text`.
4. On task completion, the agent emits a `task_completed` event.
5. Task Manager listens for the event and updates the workflow status.
