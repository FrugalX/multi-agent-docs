# Project Execution Plan: Migrating from Static Workflow Engine to Dynamic Workflow Engine

## Objective
To migrate the static workflow engine to a dynamic workflow engine, enabling runtime task coordination, dynamic task registration, and event-driven execution.

---

## Project Execution Steps

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Familiarization**

#### Step 1: Understand Static Workflow Implementation
- **Objective**: Gain a thorough understanding of the existing static workflow implementation.
- **Activities**:
  - Review codebase, architecture, and functionality of the static engine.
  - Document the limitations of the static approach in handling dynamic tasks.

#### Step 2: Research Event-Driven Design Patterns
- **Objective**: Learn about event-driven architectures and their applicability to dynamic workflows.
- **Activities**:
  - Study examples of event-driven systems.
  - Understand libraries/tools like Node.js `EventEmitter`, RabbitMQ, or Apache Kafka (if needed).

#### Step 3: Define Migration Goals
- **Objective**: Establish clear requirements for the dynamic workflow engine.
- **Activities**:
  - Identify key features to enable: dynamic task registration, event-based triggers, agent communication.
  - Create a migration roadmap with priorities.

---

### **Phase 2: Design and Initial Prototyping**

#### Step 4: Design Dynamic Workflow Architecture
- **Objective**: Create a new architecture to support dynamic workflows.
- **Activities**:
  - Design components such as Event Manager, Workflow Registry, and Task Orchestrator.
  - Prepare a high-level architecture diagram.

#### Step 5: Develop a Basic Event Manager
- **Objective**: Implement a lightweight Event Manager for handling task events.
- **Activities**:
  - Use a simple pub/sub pattern for emitting and listening to events.
  - Test the Event Manager with mock events.

#### Step 6: Implement a Task Registration System
- **Objective**: Build a system to allow tasks to be dynamically registered.
- **Activities**:
  - Create a registry to store task metadata.
  - Implement APIs to add and retrieve task definitions.

---

### **Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation**

#### Step 7: Integrate Event Manager with Task Registration
- **Objective**: Enable tasks to trigger events and react to task completions.
- **Activities**:
  - Link the Event Manager to the task registry.
  - Define event payload formats.

#### Step 8: Create Workflow Execution Orchestrator
- **Objective**: Build a component to manage and execute dynamic workflows.
- **Activities**:
  - Develop logic for processing events in sequence or parallel.
  - Test with static workflows first to ensure compatibility.

#### Step 9: Introduce Dynamic Workflow Creation
- **Objective**: Allow workflows to be created dynamically based on runtime inputs.
- **Activities**:
  - Develop a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) or JSON schema for defining workflows.
  - Validate and store workflow definitions in the registry.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing and Optimization**

#### Step 10: Run Integration Tests
- **Objective**: Test dynamic workflow functionality in end-to-end scenarios.
- **Activities**:
  - Create test cases for various workflow scenarios.
  - Simulate task events and verify correct execution.

#### Step 11: Optimize Event Processing
- **Objective**: Improve performance and scalability of the workflow engine.
- **Activities**:
  - Profile the system to identify bottlenecks.
  - Optimize event handling and registry access.

#### Step 12: Add Error Handling and Logging
- **Objective**: Ensure robustness and traceability in dynamic workflows.
- **Activities**:
  - Implement error propagation and retry mechanisms.
  - Add comprehensive logs for debugging and monitoring.

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation**

#### Step 13: Migrate Existing Static Workflows
- **Objective**: Transition existing workflows to the dynamic engine.
- **Activities**:
  - Convert static workflow definitions to the new format.
  - Test and verify correctness post-migration.

#### Step 14: Prepare User Documentation
- **Objective**: Provide clear instructions for developers using the dynamic workflow engine.
- **Activities**:
  - Document APIs, workflow schema, and event formats.
  - Include examples and best practices.

#### Step 15: Deploy to Production
- **Objective**: Release the dynamic workflow engine.
- **Activities**:
  - Deploy to a staging environment for final tests.
  - Roll out to production and monitor performance.

## Appendix: Preliminary Architecture and Design

### **Dynamic Workflow Engine Architecture**
1. **Event Manager**:
   - Handles task-based events such as `task_completed` and `data_ready`.
   - Implements pub/sub pattern for event communication.

2. **Workflow Registry**:
   - Stores workflow definitions and task metadata.
   - Provides APIs for adding, retrieving, and updating workflows.

3. **Task Orchestrator**:
   - Coordinates task execution based on event triggers.
   - Supports sequential and parallel task processing.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Tracks workflow progress and logs execution details.
   - Provides insights for debugging and optimization.

### **Example Workflow JSON**
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "user_registration",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "send_welcome_email",
      "type": "email",
      "inputs": { "email": "{{user_email}}" },
      "triggers": ["user_registered"]
    },
    {
      "task_id": "create_user_profile",
      "type": "database",
      "inputs": { "user_data": "{{user_data}}" },
      "triggers": ["user_registered"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **JSON Schema for Workflow Definition**
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "workflow_id": { "type": "string" },
    "tasks": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "task_id": { "type": "string" },
          "type": { "type": "string" },
          "inputs": { "type": "object" },
          "triggers": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "string" }
          }
        },
        "required": ["task_id", "type", "triggers"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["workflow_id", "tasks"]
}
```
