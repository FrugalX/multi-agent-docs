# Project Execution Plan: Dynamic Workflow Engine

## Objective
Develop a Dynamic Workflow Engine that allows event-driven, dynamic task coordination between agents in a multi-agent system. This project assumes the implementation starts directly with the dynamic design rather than transitioning from a static workflow.

---

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### **Phase 1: Initialization and Basic Setup**

#### **Step 1: Project Setup**
- **Goal**: Set up the development environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Set up a Node.js project.
  - Install required libraries (e.g., `express`, `ws` for WebSocket support, `ajv` for JSON schema validation).

#### **Step 2: Define JSON Schema**
- **Goal**: Define the schema for workflows, tasks, and events.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a JSON schema for workflows that includes task dependencies and event definitions.
  - Validate sample workflows using the schema.

---

### **Phase 2: Workflow Parsing and Management**

#### **Step 3: Workflow Parser**
- **Goal**: Create a parser to read and validate workflows.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to load workflows from JSON files.
  - Validate workflows against the JSON schema.

#### **Step 4: In-Memory Workflow Store**
- **Goal**: Implement an in-memory store to manage workflows.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop CRUD operations for workflows in memory.
  - Include indexing for quick lookup of tasks and dependencies.

---

### **Phase 3: Event-Driven Execution**

#### **Step 5: Event Dispatcher**
- **Goal**: Develop an event dispatcher to handle task-based events.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a WebSocket-based event system for communication.
  - Ensure tasks can emit and listen for events (e.g., `task_completed`, `data_ready`).

#### **Step 6: Task Execution Engine**
- **Goal**: Implement the logic for executing tasks based on events.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a task execution engine to trigger tasks when dependencies are resolved.
  - Test the engine with sample workflows.

---

### **Phase 4: Dynamic Agent Coordination**

#### **Step 7: Dynamic Agent Spawning**
- **Goal**: Allow agents to be dynamically created based on workflow requirements.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement an API for dynamic agent creation.
  - Assign tasks to agents and monitor their execution.

#### **Step 8: Coordination Mechanisms**
- **Goal**: Develop coordination mechanisms for agents.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement synchronization for interdependent tasks.
  - Use events to trigger and coordinate agent actions.

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Optimization**

#### **Step 9: End-to-End Testing**
- **Goal**: Test the complete system with real-world workflows.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create complex sample workflows to test dynamic execution.
  - Identify and resolve bottlenecks in event handling or task execution.

#### **Step 10: Optimization and Error Handling**
- **Goal**: Ensure the system is efficient and robust.
- **Tasks**:
  - Optimize the event dispatcher for performance.
  - Add comprehensive error handling for tasks and workflows.

## Example JSON Workflow

```json
{
  "workflowId": "exampleWorkflow",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "taskId": "task1",
      "dependencies": [],
      "eventOnComplete": "task1_completed"
    },
    {
      "taskId": "task2",
      "dependencies": ["task1"],
      "eventOnComplete": "task2_completed"
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "eventId": "task1_completed",
      "triggerTask": "task2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSON Schema for Workflows

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "workflowId": { "type": "string" },
    "tasks": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "taskId": { "type": "string" },
          "dependencies": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "eventOnComplete": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["taskId", "dependencies", "eventOnComplete"]
      }
    },
    "events": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "eventId": { "type": "string" },
          "triggerTask": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["eventId", "triggerTask"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["workflowId", "tasks", "events"]
}
```
