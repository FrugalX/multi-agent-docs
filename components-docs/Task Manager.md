# **Task Manager**

## **Synopsis**

### **Objective**
The **Task Manager** acts as the integration hub of the multi-agent system, ensuring seamless coordination, tracking, and communication between pre-existing, validated components. It is responsible for managing tasks across the system, resolving dependencies, and consolidating results. Its primary goal is to unify the various components—such as the Task Decomposition Engine, Dynamic Workflow Engine, and Dynamic Agent System—into a cohesive and efficient system.

---

### **Project Description**
In a multi-agent environment, validated components handle specialized aspects of task orchestration. The Task Manager integrates these components by:
- Accepting decomposed tasks from the **Task Decomposition Engine**.
- Dynamically creating and assigning agents through the **Dynamic Agent Creator**.
- Managing task dependencies and coordinating workflows via the **Dynamic Workflow Engine**.
- Providing real-time status updates and consolidating results for the user.

By serving as the central coordinator, the Task Manager ensures the multi-agent system functions as an integrated, reliable, and efficient platform.

---

## **Scope of Work**
1. Integrate with the **Task Decomposition Engine** to receive sub-tasks.
2. Interface with the **Dynamic Agent Creator** to instantiate agents dynamically.
3. Coordinate workflows using the **Dynamic Workflow Engine**.
4. Build mechanisms for error handling, retries, and logging.
5. Provide APIs for external components and a web interface to fetch task statuses and results.

---

## **Deliverables**
1. A fully functional Task Manager component.
2. APIs for task creation, monitoring, and result retrieval.
3. Comprehensive documentation of its architecture, APIs, and interactions with other components.

## **Appendix: Preliminary Architecture and Design**

### **Core Responsibilities**
The Task Manager performs the following key roles:
- **Integration**: Ensures seamless communication between pre-existing components.
- **Task Coordination**: Manages the lifecycle of tasks across the system.
- **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures that dependent tasks execute in the correct sequence.
- **Error Handling**: Detects failures, retries tasks, and escalates critical issues.

---

### **Architecture**

#### **1. Input Layer**
- **Task Input API**: Accepts tasks and sub-tasks from the Task Decomposition Engine.
- **Dynamic Agent Requests**: Interfaces with the Dynamic Agent Creator to spin up agents for specific tasks.

#### **2. Core Logic Layer**
- **Task Registry**: Stores metadata for all tasks (e.g., IDs, states, dependencies).
- **Assignment Engine**: Matches tasks to agents based on type, complexity, and availability.
- **Dependency Manager**: Tracks task dependencies and triggers tasks when dependencies are resolved.
- **Error Manager**: Handles task failures with retries, escalations, and logging.

#### **3. Output Layer**
- **Workflow Coordination**: Communicates with the Dynamic Workflow Engine for task progression and event management.
- **Result Aggregator**: Collects outputs from agents and compiles results for users.
- **Monitoring API**: Provides real-time status updates for tasks and workflows.

---

### **Workflow Example**

#### **Task Lifecycle**
1. **Task Submission**:
   - A high-level task is received from the Task Decomposition Engine.
   - Sub-tasks are registered in the Task Registry with their dependencies.
2. **Agent Assignment**:
   - Sub-tasks are matched to appropriate agents through the Assignment Engine.
   - Agents are dynamically created and assigned using the Dynamic Agent Creator.
3. **Task Execution**:
   - Tasks are executed by agents.
   - The Dependency Manager ensures tasks with dependencies wait for prerequisite tasks to complete.
4. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Task states are updated in real-time and shared via the Monitoring API.
5. **Error Resolution**:
   - The Error Manager handles failures and retries tasks as needed.
6. **Result Delivery**:
   - Results are aggregated and made available through the Result Aggregator.

---

### **Technologies and Tools**
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB or Firebase (to store tasks and statuses).
- **Integration APIs**: Interfaces for Task Decomposition Engine, Dynamic Agent Creator, and Dynamic Workflow Engine.
- **Communication Protocols**: WebSocket or REST APIs for task updates and monitoring.

### **JSON Schema for Task Registry**
```json
{
  "taskId": "string",
  "parentId": "string", // ID of the parent task, null if root task
  "taskType": "string",
  "status": "string", // e.g., "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "failed"
  "dependencies": ["string"], // List of prerequisite task IDs
  "assignedAgent": "string", // ID of the assigned agent
  "result": "object", // Task output
  "error": "string", // Error message, if any
  "createdAt": "string", // Timestamp
  "updatedAt": "string" // Timestamp
}
```

---

### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Scalability**: Support for high task volumes through asynchronous processing.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure reliability.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSocket for instant task status updates.
4. **Extensibility**: Modular design to support future enhancements (e.g., advanced task prioritization).
