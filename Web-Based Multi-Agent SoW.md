# Self-Orchestrated Multi-Agent System for Collaborative Task Management

## Objective
This project aims to develop a **web-based platform** that orchestrates multiple intelligent agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to collaboratively perform generative AI tasks. The solution will demonstrate decentralized decision-making and task execution, providing a scalable and interactive system for real-world applications.

---

## Project Description
Generative AI systems are revolutionizing industries with their ability to process and generate human-like language. This project focuses on integrating LLMs within a **multi-agent framework** to address complex tasks through collaboration. By decomposing high-level goals into sub-tasks, the system leverages specialized agents to execute these tasks dynamically and autonomously.

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Task Orchestration**: A central task manager assigns, monitors, and reassigns tasks.
2. **Generative AI Integration**: Agents use LLMs to perform tasks such as text summarization, content generation, or chatbot interactions.
3. **Dynamic Workflow**: Agents communicate through an event-driven system, ensuring smooth task coordination.
4. **Web-Based Interface**: Users interact with and monitor the system via a scalable browser interface.

This project provides an opportunity to explore cutting-edge technologies, focusing on distributed AI systems, LLMs, and web-based application design.

## Scope of Work
The project will involve:
1. Designing and developing a **web-based interface** using Node.js and React.js for task input, progress monitoring, and result visualization.
2. Creating an **LLM-based Task Decomposition Engine** to analyze high-level goals and break them into sub-tasks.
3. Implementing a **Task Manager** to manage task creation, assignments, and monitoring.
4. Building a **Dynamic Agent System** to execute sub-tasks using LLMs via APIs.
5. Developing an **Event-Driven Workflow Engine** for real-time communication and task orchestration.

## Deliverables
1. A functional web-based multi-agent orchestration system.
2. Visual representations of agent activity and task workflows.
3. A comprehensive project report detailing system design, implementation, and outcomes.

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastering the integration of LLMs within distributed systems.
- Gaining hands-on experience in event-driven programming and multi-agent systems.
- Understanding task decomposition and workflow orchestration in decentralized systems.
- Developing skills in modern web technologies (Node.js, React.js).

# Appendix: Preliminary Architecture and Design

## Core Components

### Task Manager
- Central controller to handle task creation, decomposition, assignments, and monitoring.
- Responsible for maintaining task statuses and ensuring smooth execution.

### Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine
- Uses LLM-based APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini or Llama API) to analyze high-level goals.
- Automatically generates an optimal set of sub-tasks, providing execution details for agents.

### Dynamic Agent System
- Agents are dynamically instantiated for each sub-task.
- Each agent specializes in a specific task type (e.g., text generation, summarization).
- Implements a microservices-like architecture for modularity and scalability.

### Event-Driven Workflow Engine
- Facilitates inter-agent communication and task progression.
- Listens for and triggers events (e.g., `task_completed`, `data_ready`) to coordinate workflows.

### Web-Based Interface
- Built using Node.js (backend) and React.js (frontend).
- Enables users to input tasks, monitor progress, and view results.

---

## Workflow Example
1. **User Input**: High-level task provided via the web interface.
2. **Task Decomposition**:
   - The input is sent to the Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine.
   - Sub-tasks are generated and sent to the Task Manager.
3. **Task Assignment**:
   - The Task Manager assigns sub-tasks to dynamically created agents.
   - Agents are monitored for progress and output.
4. **Agent Execution**:
   - Agents execute tasks using LLM APIs and emit events (`task_completed`).
   - Outputs are forwarded to dependent tasks or stored for final aggregation.
5. **Workflow Coordination**:
   - The Event-Driven Workflow Engine ensures dependencies are resolved and tasks progress smoothly.
6. **Result Delivery**:
   - Final results are displayed on the web interface for user review.

## Technologies and Tools

### Programming Stack
- Node.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS (web interface).
- MongoDB or Firebase (task and event storage).

### AI Tools
- OpenAI API, Gemini API, llama API, or equivalent LLM solutions.

### Communication Protocols
- WebSocket for real-time event communication.

---

## Key Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to operate independently for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **Scalability**: The system supports dynamic addition of agents and tasks without performance degradation.
- **Robustness**: Error handling and logging mechanisms ensure fault tolerance.

This architecture serves as a foundation for building a scalable, web-based Generative AI system that leverages the power of LLMs and modern web technologies.
