# Static Workflow Engine for Multi-Agent AI Systems

## **Project Execution Plan**

This document outlines an iterative plan to implement the Static Workflow Engine for Multi-Agent AI Systems project. Each step builds progressively towards the final goal, ensuring a manageable learning curve for undergraduates.

---

### **Phase 1: Basic Setup and Environment**

1. **Set up the development environment**:
   - Install Node.js, npm, and other basic tools.
   - Create a GitHub repository for version control.

2. **Learn and integrate a basic LLM API**:
   - Choose either Hugging Face's Llama 2 API or Googleâ€™s Gemini API.
   - Write a script to send a query to the API and log the response.

3. **Create a basic server**:
   - Use Node.js and Express.js to set up a REST API backend.
   - Define a `/task` endpoint that returns a hardcoded response.

4. **Test basic communication**:
   - Build a simple client (Node.js script or React app).
   - Test the flow between the client, backend, and LLM API.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Workflow Implementation**

5. **Define a JSON schema for workflows**:
   - Design a schema to represent static workflows.
   - Validate the schema with sample JSON files.

6. **Implement workflow parsing**:
   - Create a function to parse the workflow JSON file.
   - Log the parsed data for verification.

7. **Create basic task execution logic**:
   - Write a function to execute a single task (e.g., log a message).

8. **Integrate LLM API into tasks**:
   - Modify the execution logic to use the LLM API for specific tasks.
   - Test with one sample task and log the API response.

---

### **Phase 3: Workflow Execution**

9. **Implement sequential task execution**:
   - Develop a function to execute tasks in the order specified in the JSON.

10. **Add simple task dependencies**:
    - Update the JSON schema to include dependencies.
    - Modify task execution to ensure dependent tasks wait for prerequisites.

11. **Create event-based triggers**:
    - Use Node.js events to handle task-based triggers (e.g., `task_completed`).
    - Test the event-driven execution flow.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**

12. **Test basic workflows**:
    - Execute sample workflows and verify task outputs.

13. **Handle errors gracefully**:
    - Implement error handling for failed tasks and API calls.
    - Add retry logic for transient errors.

14. **Improve logging and debugging**:
    - Use libraries like Winston or Pino for structured logging.
    - Log task status, API interactions, and workflow execution details.

---

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features**

15. **Extend task types**:
    - Add more task types (e.g., Summarize, Translate, Classify).
    - Test each type with realistic examples.

16. **Introduce file-based input/output**:
    - Allow tasks to read/write files for input and output.
    - Test file integration with the task execution engine.

17. **Build a basic UI**:
    - Develop a React-based interface to define workflows and monitor execution.
    - Connect the UI to the backend API.

18. **Document API endpoints**:
    - Write detailed documentation for REST API endpoints.
    - Include examples and usage instructions.

---

### **Phase 6: Finalization**

19. **Test with real-world workflows**:
    - Create realistic workflows that simulate multi-agent coordination.
    - Evaluate system performance and identify bottlenecks.

20. **Prepare final documentation**:
    - Write a comprehensive project report.
    - Include examples of workflows and results.

21. **Deploy the project**:
    - Deploy the backend using cloud services like Heroku or AWS.
    - Host the UI on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

22. **Present the project**:
    - Create a presentation with a live demo.
    - Highlight key learnings, challenges, and outcomes.

## **Notes for Students**
- Start small and test each step thoroughly before moving to the next.
- Use online forums and documentation to resolve issues.
- Keep the codebase clean and commit changes regularly to GitHub.

By following this step-by-step plan, the project can be executed efficiently, ensuring a strong learning experience and a successful outcome.
