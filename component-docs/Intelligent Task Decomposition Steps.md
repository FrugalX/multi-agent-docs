# Project Execution Plan: Intelligent Task Decomposition Component

## Overview
The Intelligent Task Decomposition component is responsible for analyzing high-level tasks and breaking them into smaller, manageable sub-tasks using an LLM-powered task parser. The aim is to streamline the execution of complex workflows by enabling automated and efficient task decomposition.

This project will be executed using an iterative lifecycle, ensuring incremental progress and manageable complexity for an undergraduate student.

## Execution Steps

### **Step 1: Setup and Environment Preparation**
1. Install Node.js and required package managers (npm or yarn).
2. Familiarize yourself with using an LLM API such as Llama 2 on Hugging Face or Google Gemini.
3. Set up a basic JavaScript/Node.js environment.

**Deliverables:**
- A working development environment.
- Successful API call to LLM, returning basic responses.

---

### **Step 2: Define Input and Output Format**
1. Decide the JSON structure for high-level tasks and sub-tasks.
2. Create a sample input file (e.g., `sample_tasks.json`).
3. Define the expected output format for the decomposed tasks.

**Deliverables:**
- Well-defined JSON schema for tasks.
- Example input and output files.

---

### **Step 3: Implement Basic Task Parsing**
1. Write a script to send a task description to the LLM and receive a response.
2. Parse the response to identify meaningful sub-tasks.
3. Display the sub-tasks in the console.

**Deliverables:**
- A Node.js script that parses basic tasks.
- Sample output demonstrating sub-task extraction.

---

### **Step 4: Validate Task Parsing Logic**
1. Add validation rules to ensure the sub-tasks are actionable and relevant.
2. Enhance the parsing logic to handle diverse task descriptions.
3. Test the parser with multiple inputs.

**Deliverables:**
- A refined task parser.
- Test cases and outputs.

---

### **Step 5: Add Support for Task Attributes**
1. Extend the JSON schema to include attributes like deadlines, priorities, and dependencies.
2. Update the task parser to extract these attributes from the LLM response.
3. Validate the updated JSON structure.

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced JSON schema with task attributes.
- Updated script to parse and validate attributes.

---

### **Step 6: Implement Error Handling and Edge Case Support**
1. Add error-handling mechanisms to handle incomplete or ambiguous LLM responses.
2. Define fallback behaviors (e.g., manual task validation prompts).
3. Test edge cases and improve robustness.

**Deliverables:**
- Error-handling code for task parsing.
- Documentation of edge cases and resolutions.

---

### **Step 7: Build a Simple Web Interface (Optional)**
1. Use a basic frontend framework (e.g., React.js) to create a simple UI.
2. Allow users to input tasks and view decomposed sub-tasks in real-time.

**Deliverables:**
- A functional web interface for task decomposition.
- Interactive demonstration of the system.

---

### **Step 8: Integrate with Workflow Engine**
1. Prepare the decomposed tasks for integration with the Static Workflow Engine.
2. Format the output to match the workflow engineâ€™s requirements.
3. Test the end-to-end workflow.

**Deliverables:**
- Seamless integration with the Static Workflow Engine.
- Documentation of integration steps.

---

### **Step 9: Final Testing and Optimization**
1. Conduct thorough testing with diverse task descriptions.
2. Optimize the task parser for performance and reliability.
3. Document the system and prepare a final project report.

**Deliverables:**
- A robust and optimized task decomposition component.
- Comprehensive project documentation.
