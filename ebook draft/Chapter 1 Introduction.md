# Chapter 1: Introduction to Generative AI and Agents

## **1.1 What is Generative AI?**
Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems capable of generating new content, such as text, images, music, or code, based on patterns and data they’ve been trained on. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily recognizes patterns or makes decisions, generative AI creates novel outputs by learning the underlying structure of the input data. For example:

- **Text Generation**: Writing articles, stories, or even code.
- **Image Creation**: Designing artwork, photorealistic images, or graphics.
- **Music Composition**: Generating melodies or complete musical pieces.

Popular tools include OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s Llama.

## **1.2 Understanding AI Agents**
An AI agent is a system capable of perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Agents can be categorized as:

- **Reactive Agents**: Respond directly to stimuli without maintaining an internal state.
- **Deliberative Agents**: Use internal models to plan actions based on objectives.
- **Learning Agents**: Adapt their behavior based on past experiences.

### Key Features:
- **Autonomy**: Operates without direct human intervention.
- **Perception**: Gathers data from its environment.
- **Action**: Performs tasks or generates outputs based on goals.

## **1.3 Types of AI Agents: Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent**
### **Single-Agent Systems**
A single-agent system involves one independent entity focused on specific tasks. Examples include:
- A chatbot answering customer queries.
- A text generator creating content for blogs.

### **Multi-Agent Systems**
Multi-agent systems (MAS) consist of multiple agents interacting to achieve a common goal or solve complex problems. These agents can:
- **Collaborate**: Work together to complete tasks.
- **Compete**: Act independently with conflicting goals.

#### Example Scenarios:
- **Collaboration**: A team of agents summarizing different parts of a research paper.
- **Competition**: Simulating market dynamics in economic models.
