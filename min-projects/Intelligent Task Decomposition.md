# Intelligent Task Decomposition

## Objective
Develop a system that uses an LLM-based task parser to decompose high-level goals into a set of structured and actionable sub-tasks.

## Description
This sub-project focuses on analyzing user inputs to break them into smaller, manageable sub-tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini or Llama 2. The task decomposition engine will form a critical component of the larger multi-agent system by generating specific, actionable tasks that agents can execute independently. The design emphasizes modularity to ensure easy integration with other components in the project.

## Deliverables
1. **User Interface:** A simple interface for inputting high-level tasks and visualizing sub-task outputs.
2. **LLM Integration:** Use an LLM API to handle natural language understanding and task parsing.
3. **Prompt Library:** A collection of optimized prompts to cover a range of task types and domains.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Parsing:** Use LLM capabilities to interpret high-level goals.
- **Sub-Task Optimization:** Ensure generated sub-tasks are clear, non-redundant, and actionable.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where task decomposition is ambiguous or fails.

## High-Level Design
### Components
1. **Input Parser:** Processes user input and prepares it for LLM-based analysis.
2. **Task Generator:** Interacts with the LLM API to produce sub-tasks.
3. **Task Optimizer:** Validates and refines generated sub-tasks for clarity and feasibility.

### Workflow
1. User provides a high-level task via the interface.
2. Input is sent to the LLM API using pre-defined prompts.
3. Generated sub-tasks are validated and optimized.
4. Sub-tasks are displayed to the user and sent to the Task Manager.

### Technology Stack
- **Languages:** Node.js, JavaScript.
- **LLM APIs:** Google Gemini or Llama 2.
- **Frameworks:** Express.js (for API integration).
- **Libraries:** Axios (for API calls), Tailwind CSS (for UI).

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Research and setup the LLM API.
- **Week 3-5:** Develop the input parser and task generator.
- **Week 6-8:** Optimize task generation and handle edge cases.
- **Week 9-12:** Integrate the system with the Task Manager and finalize the UI.
