# Dynamic Agent Creation

## Objective
Design and implement a system for dynamically creating and managing AI agents based on the sub-tasks identified by the Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine.

## Description
This sub-project focuses on building a mechanism for dynamically generating agents to execute specific sub-tasks. Each agent will have well-defined responsibilities and will communicate with other agents and the Task Manager through an event-driven workflow. The goal is to ensure scalability and efficiency in handling complex workflows by automating agent creation and coordination.

## Deliverables
1. **Agent Template:** A reusable template for creating agents with task-specific capabilities.
2. **Agent Creation System:** A dynamic mechanism to instantiate agents based on incoming sub-tasks.
3. **Event Handlers:** Mechanisms for agents to handle task-based events like task_completed or data_ready.
4. **Monitoring Dashboard:** A simple interface to monitor active agents and their tasks.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Instantiation:** Automatically generate agents for incoming sub-tasks.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Agents trigger and listen for workflow events.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently handle increasing numbers of tasks and agents.

## High-Level Design
### Components
1. **Agent Factory:** A service for creating and initializing agents.
2. **Agent Registry:** A central system to track active agents and their tasks.
3. **Event Bus:** Facilitates communication between agents and other system components.

### Workflow
1. The Task Manager sends sub-tasks to the Agent Factory.
2. The Agent Factory creates agents dynamically based on task requirements.
3. Agents execute their tasks and publish task events to the Event Bus.
4. The Agent Registry monitors agent activity and updates task statuses.

### Technology Stack
- **Languages:** Node.js, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks:** Express.js (for API integration).
- **Libraries:** EventEmitter (for event-driven architecture), Tailwind CSS (for UI).
- **LLM APIs:** Google Gemini or Llama 2 (for agent capabilities).

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Research agent creation patterns and set up the Agent Factory.
- **Week 3-5:** Develop the event-driven communication system.
- **Week 6-8:** Implement agent monitoring and registry.
- **Week 9-12:** Integrate with the Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine and finalize the system.
