# Dynamic Workflow Engine

## Objective
Develop an event-driven dynamic workflow engine that facilitates task-based communication and coordination among AI agents, enabling efficient execution of complex workflows.

## Description
This sub-project involves designing and implementing a workflow engine that manages the lifecycle of tasks and the interactions between dynamically created agents. The engine will be event-driven and component-based, allowing for modular and extensible functionality. By standardizing task-based communication, the engine ensures seamless collaboration between agents.

## Deliverables
1. **Workflow Engine Core:** A lightweight engine to manage tasks and events.
2. **Event Handlers:** Pre-defined event types such as task_completed and data_ready.
3. **Task Lifecycle Management:** Capabilities to track task status from creation to completion.
4. **Extensibility Framework:** Mechanisms to add new task types and events easily.

## Key Features
- **Event-Driven Design:** Efficient communication using events for task updates and inter-agent coordination.
- **Modularity:** Component-based design to allow future extensions.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Detect and recover from task failures or miscommunications.

## High-Level Design
### Components
1. **Event Manager:** Centralized system to handle task-based events.
2. **Task Tracker:** Tracks the status and progress of tasks.
3. **Agent Interface:** Standardized APIs for agents to interact with the workflow engine.
4. **Logging and Monitoring:** Captures system logs and provides real-time task monitoring.

### Workflow
1. Sub-tasks from the Task Manager are passed to the Workflow Engine.
2. The Event Manager handles task events, notifying relevant agents.
3. Agents update task statuses through the Task Tracker.
4. Task completions or errors are logged and reflected in the monitoring dashboard.

### Technology Stack
- **Languages:** Node.js, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks:** Express.js (for APIs).
- **Libraries:** EventEmitter (for event-driven architecture), Winston (for logging).
- **Visualization Tools:** React.js, Tailwind CSS (for monitoring UI).

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Design the event-driven architecture and set up the Event Manager.
- **Week 3-5:** Develop the Task Tracker and basic event handlers.
- **Week 6-8:** Implement monitoring and logging functionalities.
- **Week 9-12:** Integrate with the Agent Factory and finalize the engine.
