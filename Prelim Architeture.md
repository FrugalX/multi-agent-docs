# Preliminary Architecture and Design

## Core Components

### Task Manager
- Central controller to handle task creation, decomposition, assignments, and monitoring.
- Responsible for maintaining task statuses and ensuring smooth execution.

### Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine
- Uses LLM-based APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini or Llama API) to analyze high-level goals.
- Automatically generates an optimal set of sub-tasks, providing execution details for agents.

### Dynamic Agent System
- Agents are dynamically instantiated for each sub-task.
- Each agent specializes in a specific task type (e.g., text generation, summarization).
- Implements a microservices-like architecture for modularity and scalability.

### Event-Driven Workflow Engine
- Facilitates inter-agent communication and task progression.
- Listens for and triggers events (e.g., `task_completed`, `data_ready`) to coordinate workflows.

### Web-Based Interface
- Built using Node.js (backend) and React.js (frontend).
- Enables users to input tasks, monitor progress, and view results.

## Workflow Example
1. **User Input**: High-level task provided via the web interface.
2. **Task Decomposition**:
   - The input is sent to the Intelligent Task Decomposition Engine.
   - Sub-tasks are generated and sent to the Task Manager.
3. **Task Assignment**:
   - The Task Manager assigns sub-tasks to dynamically created agents.
   - Agents are monitored for progress and output.
4. **Agent Execution**:
   - Agents execute tasks using LLM APIs and emit events (`task_completed`).
   - Outputs are forwarded to dependent tasks or stored for final aggregation.
5. **Workflow Coordination**:
   - The Event-Driven Workflow Engine ensures dependencies are resolved and tasks progress smoothly.
6. **Result Delivery**:
   - Final results are displayed on the web interface for user review.

## Technologies and Tools

### Programming Stack
- Node.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS (web interface).
- MongoDB or Firebase (task and event storage).

### AI Tools
- OpenAI API, Gemini API, llama API, or equivalent LLM solutions.

### Communication Protocols
- WebSocket for real-time event communication.

## Key Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to operate independently for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **Scalability**: The system supports dynamic addition of agents and tasks without performance degradation.
- **Robustness**: Error handling and logging mechanisms ensure fault tolerance.

This architecture serves as a foundation for building a scalable, web-based Generative AI system that leverages the power of LLMs and modern web technologies.
